# Hakcing-Tools
A collection of Python-based ethical hacking tools for learning and educational purposes. Includes safe utilities (WHOIS lookup, recon scripts, chatbot, wordlists) and stripped-down demo versions of advanced techniques (keylogging, brute forcing, fake prompts, screenshot capture). ⚠️ For educational use only — not for illegal activity.
